Slashdot network: Slashdot is a famous website for users to
submit current primarily technology oriented news and for edi-
tors to evaluate these news. In Slashdot website, each user can
be tagged by the other users as friends or foes. The dataset ‘‘s
oc-sign-Slashdot081106’’ in http://snap.stanford.edu/data/
#signnets is composed of 77,357 users and 516,575 tags. This
dataset can be modeled as a Slashdot network with 77,357
nodes and 516,575 directed and signed links. Notes represent
users and positive (negative) edges indicate friendly (hostile)
tags among users [6]. The largest strongly connected compo-
nent (SCC) of Slashdot network consists of 26,996 nodes and
337,351 signed directed edges. Here, its signed undirected ver-
sion, which has 22,946 nodes and 217,563 positive and 71,070
negative undirected edges, is chosen in our experiments.
